pyst: A Python Interface to Asterisk
====================================

Pyst consists of a set of interfaces and libraries to allow programming of
Asterisk from python. The library currently supports AGI, AMI, and the parsing
of Asterisk configuration files. The library also includes debugging facilities
for AGI.

Installation is the standard python install::

 tar xvf pyst.tar.gz
 cd pyst
 python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local

Documentation is currently only in python docstrings, you can use
pythons built-in help facility::

 import asterisk
 help (asterisk)
 import asterisk.agi
 help (asterisk.agi)
 import asterisk.manager
 help (asterisk.manager)
 import asterisk.config
 help (asterisk.config)

Credits

Thanks to Karl Putland for writing the original package. 
Thanks to Matthew Nicholson for maintaining the package for some years
and for handing over maintenance when he was no longer interested.

Things to do for pyst
---------------------

This is the original changelog merged into the readme file. I'm not so
sure I really want to change all these things (in particular the
threaded implementation looks good to me). I will maintain a section
summarizing the changes in this README, the ChangeLog won't be
maintained any longer. Detailed changes will be available in the version
control tool (currently svn).

* ChangeLog:
  The ChangeLog needs to be updated from the monotone logs.

* Documentation:
  All of pyst's inline documentation needs to be updated.

* manager.py:
  This should be convereted to be single threaded.  Also there is a race
  condition when a user calls manager.logoff() followed by
  manager.close().  The close() function may still call logoff again if
  the socket thread has not yet cleared the _connected flag.

  A class should be made for each manager action rather than having a
  function in a manager class.  The manager class should be adapted to
  have a send method that know the general format of the classes.

Upgrading from older versions
-----------------------------

If upgrading from...

* 0.2: Should work out of the box

* 0.1.0:

   - agi.get_variable no longer throws an exception, instead it returns an
     empty string when a channel variable is not set.
   - manager.quit() has be renamed to manager.close()

Changes
-------

Version 0.3: Minor feature enhancements

The parsing of answers from asterisk was completely rewritten. This
should fix problems people were having with commands returning embedded
'/' or empty lines.

 - Add playdtmf manager command
 - rewritten manager communication
 - should no longer choke on '/' in answers returned from a manager
   command (fixes SF Bug 2947866)
 - should now correctly parse multi-line output with embedded empty
   lines

See the ChangeLog for older changes.
