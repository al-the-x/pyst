All of pyst's inline documentation needs to be updated.

= manager.py =

This should be convereted to be single threaded.  Also there is a race 
condition when a user calls manager.logoff() followed by manager.close().  The 
close() function may still call logoff again if the socket thread has not yet 
cleared the _connected flag.

A class should be made for each manager action rather than having a function in 
a manager class.  The manager class should be adapted to have a send method 
that know the general format of the classes.
